- [ ] Browser window sized appropriately (1920x1080 recommended)
- [ ] MetaMask installed and connected to Sepolia testnet (optional)
- [ ] Test tokens in wallet for Web3 demo (optional)
- [ ] Backend server running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Frontend server running (http://localhost:5173)
- [ ] Clear browser cache for fresh demo
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs
- [ ] Disable browser notifications
- [ ] Test all animations work smoothly
- [ ] Verify keyboard shortcuts (press ?)
- [ ] Test mobile responsive view (resize to 768px)
- [ ] Prepare backup demo video (in case of technical issues)

---

## 🎯 Fallback Plan

If technical issues occur:
1. **Backend down**: Show pre-recorded demo video
2. **Upload fails**: Use pre-loaded demo data
3. **Web3 unavailable**: Skip blockchain demo, focus on AI features
4. **Animations laggy**: Mention "prefers-reduced-motion" accessibility feature
5. **Mobile view issues**: Focus on desktop experience

---

## 🏆 Closing Impact Statement

> "AutoUX combines **AI intelligence**, **Web3 verification**, and **modern UX design** to make application quality analysis accessible to everyone. It's local-first for privacy, AI-powered for intelligence, and blockchain-verified for trust. This is the future of UX analysis."

---

## 📞 Q&A Preparation

**Q: How does the AI analysis work?**
A: We use KAT-Coder-Pro LLM via OpenRouter API to analyze logs and generate intelligent recommendations based on WCAG 2.2 and Web Vitals standards.

**Q: Is the data sent to the cloud?**
A: No! Analysis happens locally. Only the AI inference call goes to OpenRouter, and we have a local fallback if the API is unavailable.

**Q: What's the Web3 integration for?**
A: It allows anchoring report hashes on Polygon testnet for integrity verification. Anyone can verify a report hasn't been tampered with.

**Q: Is it production-ready?**
A: This is a hackathon MVP. For production, we'd add: user authentication, report history, team collaboration, CI/CD integration, and more issue types.

**Q: What makes it different from other UX tools?**
A: Three things: (1) AI-powered analysis with natural language recommendations, (2) Blockchain verification for trust, (3) Gamified scoring for engagement.
